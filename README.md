## Introduction

This example project showcases how to use `@hello-pangea/dnd` to create a drag-and-drop interface within a React application built with Vite and TypeScript. The UI is styled using Mantine, a React component library.

The primary focus of this project is to demonstrate how items can be dragged:
- **Within the same column**: Items can be reordered.
- **Between different columns**: Items can be moved from one column to another.

## Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Functionality**: Easily drag items within columns and move them between columns.
- **React and TypeScript**: Built with the latest React features, including hooks, and fully typed with TypeScript for better developer experience.
- **Mantine Integration**: Styled with Mantine components, ensuring a modern and responsive UI.
- **Vite for Fast Development**: Uses Vite as the build tool for an optimized and fast development environment.
